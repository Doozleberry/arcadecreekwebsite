-----DESCRIPTION-----
A local repository for testing changes on the Arcade Creek Project frontend website.

-----THINGS TO DO-----
(FEEL FREE TO ADD ON TO THIS LIST)

Update info and replace old images and videos with new ones

Rename existing images in code (and when we replace them give them more standardized/uniform names)

Saabhir (or anyone else really), if you want to overhaul the design of the website you can go ham (if you plan to make drastic changes fork the repo https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/)

In many of the "Study Files" the formatting looks inconsistent and disgusting. Make it look consistent.

Try to remove all files related to flash and change to HTML 5 (I'm not sure if we still actually use the flash files linked in the project. Thomas said we have completely converted to HTML 5. I need to verify if what he's saying is true, but if it is we need to get rid of all unneccessary files)

Update grants in the recognition section and upload more creek lectures

Make the calendar actually display pertinent stuff, otherwise remove it
